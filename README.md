# pidgraph-notebooks
A collection of Jupyter notebooks with examples of querying different PID providers like [ORCID](https://orcid.org/), [ROR](https://ror.readme.io/), [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/) and PID graphs like the [FREYA PID Graph](https://blog.datacite.org/powering-the-pid-graph/) and [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/about) for connected objects. 

Currently included connections:
* organization-organization
* organization-people
* person-works

Please navigate into the respective folder to see the list of available notebooks. While GitHub renders Jupyter notebooks as static HTML files (not executable), each folder includes a README with links to launch the notebooks in Google Colaboratory where you can execute and modify them.

### Background
In the joint project [TAPIR](https://projects.tib.eu/tapir/en/) (Partially Automated Persistent Identifier-based Reporting), partially automated procedures for research reporting are being tested in the context of university and non-university research. To this end, the question is being investigated : 

To what extent can the necessary data aggregation be carried out on the basis of openly available research information using persistent identifiers?
